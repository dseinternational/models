# Pre-study feasibility tests

As part of planning this study, we prototyped some Bayesian statistical models and evaluated them with the proposed data sets to confirm that they might feasibly yield interesting results.

### [Feasibility Model 1: Bayesian regression](model-1/)

A Bayesian regression model to explore associations between observations of receptive vocabulary, letter sound knowledge, phonetic spelling, nonverbal ability, word reading and age with later word reading.

### [Feasibility Model 2: Bayesian Cross-Lagged Panel Model - Data Set 1](model-2/)

A Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model (RI-CLPM) to examine how three skills – vocabulary, letter sound knowledge, and word reading – develop over time and how they influence each other using repeated test scores at four time points.

### [Feasibility Model 3: Bayesian Cross-Lagged Panel Model - Data Set 2](model-3/)

An adaptation of the RI-CLPM developed for model 2 to evaluate with a second data set to explore how receptive vocabulary, spelling and word reading influence later reading outcomes using repeated test scores at four time points.
