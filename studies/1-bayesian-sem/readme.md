# Exploratory study of Bayesian Structural Equation Modelling with two longitudinal data sets

This study aims to explore the feasibility, constraints and possible practical benefits of developing statistical models of development in children with Down syndrome.

The study will examine the use of Bayesian Structural Equation Modelling to model the development of language and reading skills in children with Down syndrome, using two historic data sets, each of which assessed children at multiple points.

The study aims to answer the following questions:

1. Can useful models of language and reading skills in children with Down syndrome be developed using Bayesian Structural Equation Modelling with two existing data sets?
2. What does this tell us about the possible feasibility and usefulness of analyses of other historic data sets?
3. What does this tell us about how future data collection and data analyses may be designed to provide more useful advice for families and educators?

#### Pre-study feasibility tests

[Tests are being conducted](./models/pre-study-feasibility/) to assess the feasibility of the proposed study as part of the study planning process.
